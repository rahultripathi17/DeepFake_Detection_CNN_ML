## Introduction
In the era of rapidly advancing artificial intelligence, the proliferation of deepfake technology presents a significant challenge. Deepfakes, while offering various benefits, raise concerns regarding misinformation dissemination, particularly through manipulated images. This project addresses this challenge through the implementation of two methodologies: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and CNN with Gabor filters.

## Abstract
Our research focuses on the detection of deepfake images, employing two distinct methodologies: CNN and CNN with Gabor filters. The CNN model excels in identifying manipulated images, while the CNN with Gabor filter approach adds a nuanced layer of analysis, capturing fine texture details and expanding the model's capabilities.

## Methodology
We curated and augmented datasets, employing both CNN and CNN with Gabor filters. The Gabor filter augmentation technique involved extracting eight distinct images from each original image, enriching the dataset with a diverse array of orientations and frequencies.

Our evaluation metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of the CNN with Gabor filters approach in accurately detecting deepfake images. The model achieved superior performance compared to the standard CNN model, as indicated by metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, our study underscores the potential of leveraging Gabor filters alongside CNNs for robust and reliable deepfake detection in image-based scenarios. As the threat of deepfake manipulation continues to evolve, the exploration of innovative and effective techniques becomes imperative, and our research contributes significantly to advancing the state-of-the-art in this critical domain.

## Future Work
Future research avenues include refining model architectures, expanding datasets, exploring advanced image processing techniques, and collaborating with cybersecurity experts. Continual evaluation and adaptation are essential for developing resilient deepfake detection solutions.
